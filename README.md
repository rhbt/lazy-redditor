# The Lazy Redditor

A Chrome extension that pulls and displays images from image based subreddits and threads. 
If you want to view the images on an image based subreddit or /r/photoshopbattles thread, 
it's annoying to click every image link. With The Lazy Redditor, view all 
the images on a subreddit page or thread by clicking one button.
